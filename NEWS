# Media Session 0.4.0 (2021-10-21)

This is the first standalone release of Media Session, previously part of the
PipeWire repository. The binary name and service files remains unchanged as
pipewire-media-session and pipewire-media-session.service.

Media Session now suppports the MEDIA_SESSION_CONFIG_DIR environment variable
as lookup location for configuration files. PIPEWIRE_CONFIG_DIR continues
to be supported as before.

The equivalent to pw-uninstalled.sh in this repository is
media-session-uninstalled.sh.
